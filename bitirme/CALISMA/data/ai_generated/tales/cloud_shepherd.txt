The Cloud Shepherd

High in the mountains lived an old woman who shepherded clouds instead of sheep. With her staff, she guided rain to drought-stricken farms and moved storms away from villages. People called her crazy until the great drought came. Rivers dried, crops withered, and hope faded. The woman climbed the highest peak and called to her flockâ€”clouds from distant seas, heavy with moisture. They came slowly, reluctantly, like sheep returning home. She guided them over the valley, and rain fell for three days. When villagers climbed to thank her, they found only her staff and a note: "Every shepherd must teach another." Now, children learn to read the wind and speak to clouds, ensuring the valley never thirsts again.
