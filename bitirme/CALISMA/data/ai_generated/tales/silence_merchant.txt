The Silence Merchant

In the loudest city, a merchant sold silence. Not quiet, but true silence—the kind from before the first word. Customers would enter his shop, overwhelmed by noise, and leave carrying small boxes of absolute quiet. They'd open them in traffic, in arguments, in chaos, finding instant peace. But silence proved addictive. People stopped talking, music died, laughter vanished. The merchant realized he'd sold too much. He began mixing silence with sound—a child's giggle with mountain quiet, whispers with library peace. This balanced silence became medicine, not escape. The city learned that silence isn't absence of sound but presence of choice—choosing when to speak, when to listen, when to simply be.
