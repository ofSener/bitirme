The Scar Reader

A healer could read scars like books—each mark told its story, but more importantly, its lesson. A burn scar might whisper "courage" or "carelessness." Cut marks could mean "survival" or "surrender." She'd help people understand their scars' messages, turning wounds into wisdom. But she noticed people hiding scars, ashamed of their stories. She revealed her own—a map of failures and recoveries across her skin. The village learned that scars are proof of living, not shame. Children stopped fearing injury, understanding that scars meant stories. The healer proved that our wounds, visible and invisible, are not flaws but chapters in our body's biography, each one teaching what comfort never could.
