The Emotion Garden

A gardener grew feelings instead of flowers. Joy bloomed yellow like sunflowers, sadness dripped blue like morning glories, anger flared red as roses. Visitors could pick emotions they lacked or prune ones overgrown. A woman who'd forgotten happiness picked a bouquet of laughter. A man drowning in grief pruned his sorrow bushes. But the garden required balanceâ€”too much joy withered compassion, too little sadness eliminated empathy. The gardener taught visitors to cultivate emotional diversity, tending their internal gardens with care. They learned that all emotions, even painful ones, served purposes like seasons in nature. The garden became a sanctuary where people learned emotional ecology, understanding that feelings, like plants, need proper conditions to flourish healthily.
