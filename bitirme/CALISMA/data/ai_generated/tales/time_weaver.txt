The Time Weaver

An old woman sat at her loom, weaving not cloth but moments. Each thread held a memory: first laughs, last goodbyes, quiet afternoons. People came seeking lost timeâ€”childhood summers, forgotten conversations with loved ones. She'd weave these moments into scarves, and wearing them brought the memories alive again. A man once asked for his future instead. The weaver shook her head. "I only weave what was, not what will be. The future is yours to create, thread by thread." She gave him an empty loom and taught him to weave. He learned that making memories was more precious than reliving them. The man became a teacher, helping others weave their own timelooms, creating rather than yearning.
