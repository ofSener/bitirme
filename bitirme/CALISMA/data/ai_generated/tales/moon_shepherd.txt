The Moon Shepherd

Each night, a shepherd guided not sheep but moonbeams to where they were needed most. Through hospital windows for the dying, into children's rooms against nightmares, onto lovers' paths for romance. The moon trusted her to distribute its light fairly. But people grew greedy, demanding more moonlight, leaving others in darkness. She taught them to share by showing how moonlight multiplies when reflectedâ€”in water, windows, eyes. The more they shared, the brighter their nights became. Villages learned to position mirrors, creating networks of reflected light. The shepherd proved that celestial gifts aren't limited resources but multiply through generosity. She showed that being a conduit for light is better than hoarding it.
