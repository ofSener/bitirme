The Tear Collector

A girl collected tears in crystal vials—joy tears sparkled gold, grief tears shown silver, frustrated tears glowed red. She'd trade them at market: sad people bought joy tears, angry people sought peace tears. But tears lost potency when not freely given. Forced joy felt hollow, borrowed sorrow rang false. She learned to mix tears like perfume—a drop of child's delight, essence of mother's pride, hint of poet's melancholy. These complex emotions felt real. People learned that pure emotions are rare; we mostly feel blends. The collector became an emotional sommelier, teaching people to appreciate the subtle notes in their feeling, understanding that complexity makes us human, not pure emotions.
