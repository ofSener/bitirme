The Dream Librarian

In a tower where dreams were books, a librarian catalogued every night vision. Nightmares in the basement, hopes on high shelves, recurring dreams in circulation. People could borrow others' dreams, experiencing lives they'd never live. A farmer borrowed an astronaut's dream, a child checked out a grandmother's memories. But some never returned their borrowed dreams, living in fantasies. The librarian implemented a rule: for every dream borrowed, one must be donated. Soon, the library overflowed with fresh dreams. The exchange taught empathyâ€”understanding others through their subconscious worlds. The tower became a bridge between minds, where the sleeping and waking worlds merged, creating a collective unconscious more beautiful than any individual dream.
