The Smoke Translator

A man could read messages in smoke—campfire smoke carried stories of gathering, cigarette smoke whispered anxiety, incense smoke sang prayers. Factory smoke screamed warnings he tried to share, but nobody listened to the smoke reader. Until the day chimney smoke from every house spoke the same word: "lonely." He realized the village's isolation despite proximity. He began teaching smoke signals, not for emergency but for connection. Neighbors learned to send smoke messages—soup invitations, birth announcements, condolences. The village became wreathed in conversational smoke, a visible network of communication. He proved that pollution could become poetry if we learned its language, and that even smoke, symbol of destruction, could carry messages of hope.
