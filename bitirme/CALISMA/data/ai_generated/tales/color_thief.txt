The Color Thief

A child could steal colors with her fingertips. Touch a sunset, pocket its orange. Brush a flower, steal its purple. She hoarded colors in jars beneath her bed, leaving the world increasingly gray. Flowers became white, skies turned silver, people grew pale. When her mother fell ill, losing all color, the girl understood her theft's cost. She opened every jar, but colors wouldn't return to their sources. Instead, she learned to paint with her stolen hues, creating new beauty from her greed. She painted murals on gray walls, colored pale faces, returned vibrancy differently. The girl learned that taking beauty from the world means responsibility to create more, transforming theft into art.
