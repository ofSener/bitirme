The Wind Reader

A blind girl could read stories in the wind. Each breeze carried tales from where it had beenâ€”ocean winds spoke of sailors, mountain winds of eagles, city winds of dreams and exhaust. She'd sit on her porch, translating for anyone who'd listen. People thought her mad until she warned of a storm carrying rage from distant wars. The village prepared and survived. They began bringing her gifts of chimes and ribbons, helping her read more clearly. She taught them that every element has language if we learn to listen. Children started reading rain, elderly interpreted sunshine, and the village became fluent in nature's narratives. The girl proved that blindness to one thing often means clarity to another.
