The Root Singer

Deep underground, a woman sang to roots, helping them find water, avoid rocks, connect with fungal networks. Trees grew stronger where she sang, gardens flourished from her melodies. Farmers paid for her root songs, but she noticed something disturbingâ€”roots were already singing to each other, a subsonic chorus she'd been interrupting. She stopped singing and started listening, learning the root language of chemical signals and electrical pulses. She taught farmers to listen rather than impose, to work with root wisdom instead of directing it. The singer discovered that nature has its own music, and our role isn't to conduct but to harmonize. She proved that sometimes the best gardening is getting out of the garden's way.
