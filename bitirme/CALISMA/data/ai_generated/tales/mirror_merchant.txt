The Mirror Merchant

A merchant arrived in town selling peculiar mirrors that showed not reflections, but possibilities. Look into one, see yourself as a doctor; another, as an artist; a third, as a traveler. People flocked to buy them, mesmerized by alternate lives. But young Sofia noticed something strangeâ€”the happiest people bought no mirrors at all. She asked the merchant why. "Those mirrors show who you could be," he explained, "but the content ones already know who they are." Sofia looked at her reflection in a normal puddle and smiled. She saw a girl with dreams, fears, and choices ahead. That was enough. The merchant packed up his mirrors and left, knowing at least one person understood: the best life isn't in the mirror, but in the choosing.
