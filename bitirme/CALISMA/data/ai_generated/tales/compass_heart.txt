The Compass Heart

A girl's heart was a compass pointing not north but toward what people needed most. Near the hungry, it pointed to food. By the lonely, toward companionship. At crossroads, toward correct paths. Travelers followed her, trusting her heart's direction over maps. But constantly serving others' needs exhausted her. Her heart spun wildly, trying to point everywhere at once. An elder taught her to occasionally follow her heart's selfish directionâ€”pointing toward her own needs. She learned that self-care wasn't betrayal but necessity. The girl taught others to develop their own compass hearts, creating a network of people helping each other. She proved that knowing what others need is a gift, but knowing what you need is wisdom.
