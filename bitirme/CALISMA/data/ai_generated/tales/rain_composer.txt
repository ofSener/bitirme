The Rain Composer

A composer wrote symphonies for rain to play. Each droplet striking different surfaces created notes—tin roofs played percussion, leaves offered strings, puddles provided bass. She'd conduct storms, guiding wind and water into melodies. Farmers hired her for gentle agricultural rhythms, lovers requested romantic drizzles. But she couldn't control the emotion rain absorbed while falling through human experiences. Happy occasions produced bright rain songs, funerals created dirges. She realized rain was a collaborative composer, mixing her intentions with humanity's emotions. She stopped trying to control and started facilitating—teaching people to hear rain's natural music. Communities learned to dance with storms rather than hide from them, finding rhythm in nature's chaos.
