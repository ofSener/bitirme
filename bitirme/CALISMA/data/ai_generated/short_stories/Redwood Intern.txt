On my first day at the tech campus, orientation included a redwood tour. “Pre-cloud architecture,” the guide joked, patting bark older than our entire product line. Sprints blurred into marathons: stand-ups, late merges, caffeinated optimism. When code tangled, I ate lunch beneath the redwoods, letting my eyes refactor to vertical. A teammate confessed he wanted to quit. “These trees survived fires,” I said, surprising myself. We printed out our bug list like a medieval scroll, fixed what we could, deleted what we couldn’t defend. Quarterly review arrived with reasonable questions and unreasonable graphs. We didn’t get everything right. Still, the redwoods hummed a version control deeper than Git: rings committing growth, branch by branch. We shipped, imperfect and alive.
