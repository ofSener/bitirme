Our building’s kids declared the stairwell their parliament, but negotiations always collapsed—too many scooters, not enough snacks. Then Maya proposed a treehouse in the courtyard fig. Parents vetoed, citing liability and figs. We drafted a treaty: adults could supervise; kids would preserve branches; everyone must share popsicles. Construction took weekends and borrowed tools. The superintendent donated a ladder “on probation.” When the platform opened, pigeons boycotted, but cats approved. We posted rules in crayon: No Spitting, No Secrets That Hurt, Figs Are For Everyone. Teenagers rolled their eyes and climbed anyway. By autumn, the fig blushed purple; the treaty held. Arguments moved upward, softened by leaves. Even the superintendent attended one sunset, verdict postponed until stars arrived.
