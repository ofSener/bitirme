On maps, the forest looked tidy—green block, straight road, polite river. On foot, it was grammar without punctuation. Mushrooms offered semicolons; beeches built long clauses of shade. I hiked until signal bars vanished and my calendar stopped narrating itself. At a clearing, a lightning-struck pine stood glazed with resin. I touched the scar and heard sap ticking: the metronome of repair. A jay heckled, then forgave me. I brewed tea on a small stove, practiced breathing with the trees. Exhale: fog. Inhale: cedar. When I returned, the trailhead bulletin listed closures and warnings. My shoes were muddy with commas. The week began again, but slower, better punctuated. I carried the pine’s sentence home, still writing itself in rings.
