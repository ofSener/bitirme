The storm arrived like a drummer, quick and insistent. Our town sealed windows; the old sycamore didn’t. It lifted its thousand hands and kept time. I watched from the porch, certain it would split. It didn’t. Lightning stitched the clouds; the tree stood, humming. Afterward, neighbors gathered beside its wet trunk. Someone touched carved initials, softened by rain. Someone else found a fallen branch shaped like a question. The tree answered with shade, with birds shaking water from their wings. That night, the power still out, I dreamed of roots braiding through basements and under streets, steady as pulse. Morning smelled like pennies and leaves. The sycamore dropped one seed ball at my feet, perfectly ordinary, perfectly surviving.
