Our street wore lindens for perfume. In June, the air turned honey and bicycles. My brother left for a job across an ocean, promising postcards. They arrived irregular as weather: seaside sketches, coffee stains, a leaf taped flat once. I wrote back on index cards, cataloging the linden’s small dramas—bees, rain, a crow’s sarcastic meetings. Autumn dropped confetti, then seriousness. Winter filed everything gray. When his visit was delayed again, I brewed linden tea from the apothecary and sat beneath the bare branches anyway. The mail came late: one thick envelope, a plane ticket tucked inside. He stepped from the taxi smelling like salt and jet fuel. We walked under the lindens, whose buds already believed in June.
