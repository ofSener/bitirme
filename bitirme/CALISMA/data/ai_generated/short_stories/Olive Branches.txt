My aunt’s courtyard in the new country held two olive trees in wine barrels, diplomatic passports from the old one. She taught me pruning like conversation: cut where growth crosses, leave light for tomorrow. News traveled poorly—time zones, buffering hearts—but olives ripened right on schedule, small and serious. We crushed them with a borrowed press, collecting green-gold hope in recycled jars. At holidays, we mailed bottles home, wrapped in sweaters and prayers. Replies came months later: thank-yous, recipes, one photograph of an uncle under rubble turned to dust and sky. We planted a third olive in a cracked sidewalk square, illegal and necessary. Winter sulked; spring reconsidered. People slowed to touch its leaves, then each other’s shoulders.
