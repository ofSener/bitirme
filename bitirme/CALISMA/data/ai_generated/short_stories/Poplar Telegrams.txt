In the factory yard, poplars whispered like gossiping code. I pulled nights on Line B, ears full of conveyor hum. During breaks, we smoked under the trees and translated leaves: “storm soon,” “overtime likely,” “tell her.” One August, the union vote split like a lightning fork. Friends sharpened words; supervisors sharpened smiles. The poplars shrugged, sent more telegrams. On the hottest night, the power hiccuped and the line froze. We stepped outside. Wind ran its fingers through the stand; paper cups rolled like tumbleweed. Someone started counting out loud: paychecks, rent, diapers. Someone else told a story about their grandfather striking and planting poplars the same week. When the lights returned, we went back in together. The trees clapped once, crisp.
