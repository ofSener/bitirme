Our math club met in an abandoned orchard where variables were apples trying to be circles. We solved proofs on cardboard, chalk squeaking like startled birds. Ms. Reyes, on leave from teaching, brought thermoses and a reputation for kindness. “Assume the tree is friendly,” she’d say when limits pinched. Autumn swaggered in; we graphed ripeness versus patience. One Saturday, a boy who never spoke tossed an apple high and said, “Parabola.” We laughed like we’d won a medal. A neighbor complained; we invited her to judge our harvest theorem. She did, then brought jars for sauce. Winter erased our chalk; the trees solved snow. In spring, the district rehired Ms. Reyes. We met once more in the orchard to factor gratitude, slowly, aloud.
