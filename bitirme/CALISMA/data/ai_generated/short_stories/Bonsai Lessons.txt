Grandmother’s bonsai lived on a sunny sill, older than our apartment lease and most of our arguments. She trimmed it with kitchen scissors, murmuring weather reports. I asked why it stayed small. “Discipline,” she said, snipping a brave shoot. When my life frayed—missed rent, missed trains—she handed me the watering can. “Routine is a quiet miracle.” I measured moisture with a chopstick, turned the pot a quarter each Sunday. Slowly, the tree and I learned patience together: tiny scars sealing, new buds hesitating, then committing. When Grandmother moved to a room with fewer windows, we brought the bonsai. “Looks like a forest,” she whispered, smiling at a branch no wider than a pencil. I finally understood: size isn’t scale.
