A developer bought the old orchard, promising “heritage-inspired residences.” They felled rows, leaving three apple trees like punctuation marks. At dusk, we snuck in with thermoses, listening. The remaining trees creaked like chairs at a long meeting. My brother said he could smell cider. I said I could hear bees arguing about union rules. On demolition day, a crane paused; a nest hung in the bucket’s shadow, frantic with requests. Workers waited. By noon, the nest relocated. The crane resumed—then stalled again. The oldest tree refused, wood too stubborn for easy math. Permits expired that week; lawsuits sprouted like dandelions. Spring arrived with blossoms the color of soft promises. We brought ladders and jars, capturing ghosts as jelly.
