Campus planners called it “green infrastructure,” but we named the courtyard ginkgo “Professor.” Each October, it lectured on gold, flunking anyone who hurried. During finals, students camped beneath its fan-shaped leaves, cramming equations and breath. The literature club staged silent readings; the chess club lost spectacularly but looked wise. One spring, a rumor bloomed: the tree was older than the library. Groundskeepers laughed until an archivist found photos—same trunk, shorter buildings. We threw it a birthday with cupcakes and awkward poetry. That winter, a storm canceled classes. We shoveled a path to Professor first. Finals resumed later; deadlines chased us like geese. Still, whenever pages rustled, the tree seemed to nod, grading on a curve called shade.
