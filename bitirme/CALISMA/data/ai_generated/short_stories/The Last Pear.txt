Grandfather’s orchard was mostly ghosts now—stumps, toppled ladders, a rusted press. We visited each July anyway, carrying water and stubborn nostalgia. “Trees like being remembered,” he used to say. We found one survivor: a crooked pear, bark scarred like old knuckles. We pruned, mulched, apologized for the years. By September, the tree made nine pears, yellow as lanterns. We ate them in the truck bed, juice baptizing our wrists. Imperfect, gritty, astonishing. Somewhere between the second and third, I realized we were grafted too—his stories into my plans, my hands into his tools. Winter will come, hard and indifferent. Still, we’ll wrap burlap around the trunk, and hope. Some families keep photo albums. Ours keeps a tree.
