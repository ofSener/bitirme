The hospital’s smoking area disappeared; the elm remained. Nurses clocked out and in again, swapping scrubs and stories beneath its stubborn canopy. I worked nights mopping hallways, invisible until needed. When my mother was admitted, I learned the machines’ lullabies and the elm’s schedule: starlings at dusk, bats at shift change. On her last good evening, we wheeled her outside. She touched the elm’s ridged bark, then her chest. “Same pattern,” she said—wrinkles, rings, ribs. After she slept, I returned alone, pressing my ear to the trunk. Sap moved like a slow choir. Months later, grief loosened its fist. The elm shed seeds shaped like wings. I pocketed one, a permission slip to keep going.
