The rental had a stubborn window framing a birch like a living metronome. Every morning, the tree counted wind in silver flickers. I worked remote, measured hours in emails and tea bags. When layoffs came, the screen shrank to severance details and a blinking cursor. I stood, opened the sticky window. Outside, the birch rattled soft applause. A neighbor waved a paint-splotched hand, asked if I knew ladders. By noon, we were scraping old trim, swapping recipes and failures. Sap scented the air like aspirin. That evening, I sent three applications, honest ones. The birch kept time, not pressure. Weeks later, an offer arrived. I thanked the tree by finally fixing the sash, so the breeze could clock in too.
