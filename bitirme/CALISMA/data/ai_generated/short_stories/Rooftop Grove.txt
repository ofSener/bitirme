When the landlord paved the courtyard, we carried soil upstairs in grocery bags. Three tubs, two saplings, one reckless idea. Summer baked the roof; we rigged shade with laundry lines. The maples learned the cityâ€™s schedule: sirens at noon, pigeons at four, sunset neon. Neighbors visited with watering cans and gossip. In August, a storm bullied the skyline. We braced trunks with broom handles; lightning stitched the horizon like frantic embroidery. Morning found leaves glittered with grit and victory. By September, the trees threw a square of mercy across tar and tired bodies. We ate sandwiches in their shade, rent still rising, hearts still softening. Winter would come sharp, we knew. So we wrote our names on the tubs: Stay.
