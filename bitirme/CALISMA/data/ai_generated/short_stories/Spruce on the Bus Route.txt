Route 12 curved past a triangle of soil where a spruce soldiered between lanes. Kids called it The Christmas That Never Ends. I drove mornings, announced stops, traded weather with regulars. On solstice week, passengers began leaving ornamentsâ€”paper cranes, bottle-cap stars, hope scribbled on receipts. A mechanic strung a timid strand of lights powered by a solar panel the size of a lunch tray. After a heavy snow, the city plow kissed the spruce too hard. Needles browned on the wounded side. People argued about blame, then showed up with burlap and twine. By late February, new growth nudged through the damage. Spring canceled the lights but kept the habit: tiny messages tied to branches, green as second chances.
