I was born in Dayton, Ohio, but to tell the truth, I never felt very
comfortable there. Fortunately, I discovered different countries when I was
still a teenager. My parents traveled a lot and we were lucky to be able to
live in different countries. For I can remember Asia, especially Japan, has
always fascinated me. Europe is interesting, but most countries are not easy
to live in, although the culture and especially the food was always the best.
When I got a little older I started to travel by myself. I drove to Mexico and
traveled all the way down to Panama. These were of course more
adventurous than ordinary travels. I can honestly say that travel is
educating in many ways. You also learn different cultures and I got quite
good at developing social skills. Most Americans travel only within their
own country, and there is nothing wrong with that, but I feel that
international experiences educate more and are good for the brain.
