The Legend of Sleepy Hollow
by Washington Irving

In a quiet glen near Tarrytown, New York, there lay a little valley called Sleepy Hollow. This secluded spot seemed to cast a spell over all who lived there, filling their minds with dreamy fancies and supernatural tales. The dominant spirit of the place was the ghost of a Hessian soldier who had lost his head to a cannonball during the Revolutionary War. Local legend said this Headless Horseman rode forth nightly in search of his missing head, and that he could be seen hurrying back to the churchyard before daybreak.

In this haunted region lived Ichabod Crane, a tall, lanky schoolmaster with enormous ears, a long nose, and feet that might have been mistaken for shovels. Despite his ungainly appearance, Ichabod fancied himself quite the gentleman. He was the local singing teacher, and his greatest pleasure was reading ghost stories by Cotton Mather, especially late at night when every sound made him jump with fright.

Ichabod had fallen deeply in love with Katrina Van Tassel, the eighteen-year-old daughter of a wealthy Dutch farmer. Katrina was plump, rosy-cheeked, and as coquettish as she was beautiful. Her father's farm was the finest in the valley, with fat livestock, abundant crops, and a magnificent stone mansion that promised comfort and prosperity to whoever might win his daughter's hand.

Unfortunately for Ichabod, he had a rival—Abraham Van Brunt, known as Brom Bones. Brom was everything Ichabod was not: broad-shouldered, strong, merry, and brave. He was the hero of the neighborhood, famous for his horsemanship and his mischievous pranks. While Ichabod tried to win Katrina with his learning and singing, Brom relied on his physical prowess and natural charm.

One autumn evening, old Van Tassel invited the countryside to a harvest party at his farm. Ichabod spent extra time that day making himself presentable, and he borrowed an old plow horse named Gunpowder to ride to the party. The evening was filled with dancing, storytelling, and feasting on fried cakes, sweet cakes, gingerbread, honey cakes, and other delicacies.

As the night wore on, the older folks gathered around the fire to tell ghost stories about the supernatural happenings in Sleepy Hollow. They spoke of the woman in white who haunted the bridge, the soldier who had been found hanging from a tree, and most frightening of all, the Headless Horseman. Brom told a tale of how he had once raced the ghostly rider and would have won if they hadn't reached the church bridge, where the specter vanished in a flash of fire.

When the party ended, Ichabod lingered to court Katrina privately. What passed between them, no one knows, but when he emerged from the parlor, his face showed all the signs of a rejected suitor. He mounted poor Gunpowder and rode into the night, his head heavy with disappointment and the ghost stories he had heard.

It was the very witching hour of night when Ichabod rode through the most haunted parts of Sleepy Hollow. Every shadow seemed to take ghostly shape, and every sound made him think of supernatural visitors. As he approached the infamous church bridge where the Headless Horseman was said to vanish, he heard the clip-clop of horse's hooves behind him.

Looking back, Ichabod saw a dark figure on horseback following him. The rider appeared huge and black against the night sky, and as they drew closer to the bridge, Ichabod realized with horror that the figure had no head! Instead, the head seemed to be carried on the saddle.

Terror gave speed to Ichabod's horse, and they thundered toward the bridge. Just as they reached it, Ichabod looked back and saw the goblin rising up in his stirrups and hurling his head at him. The last thing Ichabod knew was the sensation of being struck by something hard and round.

The next morning, Gunpowder was found peacefully grazing near his master's gate. Of Ichabod there was no trace, except for his hat lying beside a shattered pumpkin near the bridge. Some said he had been carried off by the Headless Horseman, others that he had been frightened out of the countryside entirely.

Old wives in the neighborhood maintained that Ichabod was spirited away by supernatural means, but country folk knew better. It was observed that Brom Bones looked particularly pleased whenever the story was told, and he always burst into hearty laughter at the mention of the pumpkin—leading many to suspect that he knew more about the matter than he let on.

Years later, a farmer reported seeing Ichabod in a distant part of the country, where he had become a lawyer and eventually a judge. But the good wives of Sleepy Hollow preferred the ghostly version of the tale, and to this day, the bridge is still haunted by the Headless Horseman, and schoolmasters still tell the story of poor Ichabod Crane.
