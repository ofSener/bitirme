Mrs. Meyer has a severe headache. The doctor examines her shoulder and
prescribes the woman's pills that she has to take every day. In addition, the
doctor gives the woman a list of activities to do. She is supposed to do yoga
and meditation regularly, as the doctor states that the headaches come from
stress.
The woman does the activities for several days, but the headaches do not
go away. After a week she goes back to the doctor.
"Do you feel better, " asks the doctor.
She says no, and that she always gets a headache when she's nervous.
"Do you sleep enough?"
She states that she doesn't know.
After further investigation, the doctor prescribes pills for nervousness,
tablets for stress, and valium for sleeping. At home, Mrs. Meyer now has a
big box full of pills and tablets.
