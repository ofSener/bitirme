My mother and I are watching our new neighbor. Every morning at eight
o'clock he leaves his house. We're watching him from the kitchen window.
The man is young and wears a suit and tie. We think he's a man of class. He
is always coming and going at a particular time.
My mother also has many friends and often invites strange men into the
house as well. The men are very friendly and often give my mother gifts.
After their visits, we sometimes have a lot of cash on hand. Just when the
men have left, we usually rush to the mall to go shopping. One day we
meet the new neighbor in the supermarket. My mother smiles at the man.
They start talking. The neighbor comes to our house and spends time with
my mother. A month later, my mother says, "we're going to move soon. We
will live with Jeff, our neighbor, I convinced him to let us live with him.â€œ
