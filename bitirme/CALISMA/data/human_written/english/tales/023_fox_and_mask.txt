A Fox found the mask of an actor which had been thrown aside after a performance. He picked it up and looked at it carefully.
"What a fine head this is," said he, "but it has no brains inside."
The mask was beautifully painted and shaped, with a noble expression upon its face. But when the Fox turned it around, he could see that it was hollow and empty.
"Ah," said the Fox, shaking his head, "this reminds me of many people I know. They have handsome faces and fine clothes, but their heads are as empty as this mask."
