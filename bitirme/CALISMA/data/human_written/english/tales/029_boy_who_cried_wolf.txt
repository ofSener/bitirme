A young shepherd boy was bored while watching his flock of sheep. To entertain himself, he cried out, "Wolf! Wolf! The wolf is chasing the sheep!"
The villagers came running up the hill to help the boy drive the wolf away. But when they arrived at the top of the hill, they found no wolf. The boy laughed at the sight of their angry faces.
"Don't cry 'wolf', shepherd boy," said the villagers, "when there's no wolf!" They went grumbling back down the hill.
Later, the boy cried out "Wolf! Wolf!" again. Again the villagers ran to help him, only to find that there was no wolf.
Then one evening as the sun was setting behind the forest, a wolf really did come out of the woods and began to steal the sheep. The boy cried, "Wolf! Wolf!" But the villagers thought he was trying to fool them again and so they didn't come.
At sunset, everyone wondered why the shepherd boy hadn't returned to the village with their sheep. They went up the hill to find the boy weeping.
"There really was a wolf here! The flock has scattered! I cried out, 'Wolf!' but you didn't come," he wailed.
