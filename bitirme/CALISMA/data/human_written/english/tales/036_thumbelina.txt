A woman wished for a child, even a tiny one. A fairy gave her a seed that grew into a flower, and inside was a girl no bigger than a thumb - Thumbelina.
One night, an ugly toad stole Thumbelina to marry her son. Fish helped her escape on a lily pad down the river. A beetle caught her but threw her away when his friends said she was ugly.
Thumbeline lived alone through summer, but winter came and she nearly froze. A field mouse took her in, but wanted her to marry a mole who lived underground.
As spring arrived, Thumbelina found a swallow she had cared for during winter. The grateful swallow offered to take her to warmer lands.
In the flower fields, Thumbelina met a flower prince her own size. They fell in love and married, and she received wings to fly among the flowers.
