Three little pigs went into the world to build homes. The first pig built his house of straw. The second pig built his house of sticks. The third pig built his house of bricks.
A big bad wolf came to the first pig's house. "Little pig, little pig, let me in!" "Not by the hair of my chinny-chin-chin!" "Then I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house in!" The wolf blew down the straw house and the first pig ran to his brother's stick house.
The wolf came to the stick house and huffed and puffed and blew it down too. Both pigs ran to their brother's brick house.
At the brick house, the wolf huffed and puffed but could not blow it down. The house was too strong. The wolf went away, and the three little pigs lived safely ever after.
