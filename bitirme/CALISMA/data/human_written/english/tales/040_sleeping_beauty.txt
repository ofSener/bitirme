A king and queen finally had a daughter. They invited fairies to bless the child, but forgot one old fairy. At the christening, the good fairies gave gifts of beauty, grace, and song.
The forgotten fairy arrived angry and cursed the princess: "On her sixteenth birthday, she will prick her finger on a spinning wheel and die!" A kind fairy softened the curse: "She will not die, but sleep for a hundred years until a prince's kiss awakens her."
The king banned all spinning wheels, but on her sixteenth birthday, the princess found an old woman spinning in a tower. She pricked her finger and fell into deep sleep, as did everyone in the castle.
A hundred years later, a prince fought through the thick thorns that had grown around the castle. He found the sleeping princess and kissed her. She awakened, as did the entire kingdom.
They married and lived happily ever after.
