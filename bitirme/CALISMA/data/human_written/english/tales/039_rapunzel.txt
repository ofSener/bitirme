A couple stole herbs from a witch's garden. When caught, they promised their unborn child to the witch. When the baby was born, the witch took her and named her Rapunzel.
At twelve, the witch locked Rapunzel in a tower with no stairs or door, only a window at the top. Rapunzel's hair grew very long. When the witch visited, she called, "Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let down your hair!" and climbed up.
One day, a prince heard Rapunzel singing and saw how the witch climbed the tower. When the witch left, he called out the same words. Rapunzel let down her hair and he climbed up.
They fell in love and planned to escape. But the witch discovered them, cut off Rapunzel's hair, and banished her to the desert. She used the hair to trick the prince, who fell from the tower and was blinded by thorns.
The prince wandered until he found Rapunzel. Her tears of joy healed his eyes, and they lived happily together.
