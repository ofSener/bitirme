A shepherd had an old dog named Sultan who was about to be put down. The wolf suggested a plan where Sultan could save the shepherd's child from a supposed wolf attack, thus proving his worth. Sultan followed the plan, rescuing the child and earning his keep. Later, when the wolf tried to steal a sheep, Sultan warned his master, who beat the wolf. The wolf sought revenge and challenged Sultan to a fight, but with the help of a three-legged cat, they scared away the wolf and boar.
