Hans works seven years for his master and receives a lump of gold as payment. He trades it for a horse, then the horse for a cow, the cow for a pig, the pig for a goose, and finally the goose for a grindstone and rock. When these fall into a well, Hans feels relieved to be free of all burdens and walks home happily.
