Once upon a time, a Man and his Wife had the good fortune to possess a Goose which laid a Golden Egg every day. Lucky though they were, they soon began to think they were not getting rich fast enough.
They imagined that if the bird were able to lay golden eggs, its insides must be made of gold. And they thought that if they could get all that precious metal at once, they would get mighty rich very soon. So the man killed the Goose and opened it up.
But when he looked inside he found nothing but what he would find in any ordinary goose. The greedy couple thus lost the chance of gaining a golden egg every day, all because of their foolish greed for more.
