Once upon a time a Country Mouse invited his cousin, a City Mouse, to visit him in the country. The City Mouse was used to fine living, but he accepted the invitation.
When he arrived, the Country Mouse served him a simple meal of roots, grain, and acorns. The City Mouse could barely eat any of it.
"My dear cousin," said the City Mouse, "you live like an ant. Come with me to the city and I will show you how to live like a gentleman."
So the Country Mouse went to the city. The City Mouse led him to a grand house where they found the remains of a wonderful feast. Just as they began to eat, they heard barking dogs. In ran a pack of dogs, and the two mice had to run for their lives.
"Good-bye, cousin," said the Country Mouse when they were safe. "I prefer my simple life in the country to all your luxury with danger."
