A poor woman bought some beans and was cooking them. While preparing the meal, a bean, a straw, and a burning coal fell together. They began talking and decided to travel together. At a brook, the straw laid across as a bridge. When the coal tried to cross, the straw burned and broke, causing the coal to hiss and die in the water. The bean laughed so hard it split open. Fortunately, a kind tailor passing by sewed the bean back together with black thread, which is why beans have a black seam ever since.
