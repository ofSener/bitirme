A little duckling was born looking different from his brothers and sisters. He was gray and awkward while they were yellow and cute. Everyone called him ugly.
The other ducks pecked at him and chased him away. The ugly duckling felt very sad and lonely. He ran away from the farmyard to find a place where he belonged.
He wandered through the winter, cold and hungry. When spring came, he saw beautiful white swans swimming in a pond. He expected them to drive him away too, but when he looked at his reflection in the water, he gasped.
He was no longer a gray, ugly duckling. He had grown into a beautiful swan! The other swans welcomed him joyfully.
"I never dreamed I could be so happy when I was an ugly duckling," he said.
