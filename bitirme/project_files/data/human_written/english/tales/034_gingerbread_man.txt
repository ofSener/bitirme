A little old woman baked a gingerbread man. When she opened the oven, he jumped out and ran away, singing "Run, run, as fast as you can! You can't catch me, I'm the gingerbread man!"
He ran past a cow, a horse, and a pig. They all chased him, but he was too fast.
At a river, he met a sly fox. "I can help you cross," said the fox. "Jump on my nose!" The gingerbread man climbed onto the fox's nose.
As they crossed the river, the fox said, "The water is getting deeper. Climb onto my nose so you don't get wet."
When the gingerbread man climbed higher, the fox opened his mouth wide and SNAP! He ate the gingerbread man.
