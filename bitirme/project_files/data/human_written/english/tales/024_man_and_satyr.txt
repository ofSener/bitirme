A Man and a Satyr became friends and agreed to live together. Winter came, and one cold day the Man put his hands to his mouth and blew on them.
"Why do you do that?" asked the Satyr.
"To warm my hands," replied the Man. "They are so cold."
Later that day they sat down to eat some hot soup. The Man raised the bowl to his lips and blew on the soup.
"And why do you do that?" asked the Satyr again.
"To cool the soup," answered the Man. "It is too hot to eat."
"I will have nothing more to do with you," declared the Satyr, rising from the table. "I cannot be friends with a man who can blow hot and cold with the same breath."
