Little Red Riding Hood was going to visit her grandmother with a basket of food. Her mother warned her not to talk to strangers.
In the forest, she met a wolf who asked where she was going. She told him about her grandmother's house. The wolf ran ahead to the grandmother's house.
The wolf ate the grandmother and put on her clothes. When Little Red Riding Hood arrived, she noticed something strange.
"Grandmother, what big eyes you have!" "The better to see you with, my dear." "What big teeth you have!" "The better to eat you with!" The wolf jumped up.
Just then, a woodsman heard the commotion and rushed in. He chased away the wolf and rescued the grandmother from the wolf's belly.
Little Red Riding Hood learned to be more careful about talking to strangers.
