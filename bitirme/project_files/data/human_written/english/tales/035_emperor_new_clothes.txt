An emperor loved fine clothes more than anything. Two swindlers came to town claiming they could weave magical cloth that only wise people could see.
The emperor hired them to make him a suit. The swindlers pretended to work, taking gold and silk but weaving nothing. When officials came to check, they pretended to see the beautiful cloth, afraid to seem foolish.
The emperor came to see his new clothes. He saw nothing but didn't want to appear unwise, so he praised the beautiful fabric.
On the day of the parade, the swindlers "dressed" the emperor in his new clothes. The emperor walked through town in his underwear while everyone pretended to admire his outfit.
Finally, a child called out, "The emperor has no clothes!" Soon everyone was saying it. The emperor realized he had been fooled but continued the parade.
