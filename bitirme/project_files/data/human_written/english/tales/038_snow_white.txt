Snow White's stepmother, the Queen, had a magic mirror that told her Snow White was the fairest in the land. Jealous, the Queen ordered a huntsman to kill Snow White, but he let her escape into the forest.
Snow White found a cottage where seven dwarfs lived. They let her stay in exchange for keeping house. The Queen discovered Snow White was alive and disguised herself to trick her.
First, the Queen nearly strangled Snow White with tight laces. The dwarfs saved her. Next, she poisoned a comb that made Snow White unconscious. Again the dwarfs helped.
Finally, the Queen gave Snow White a poisoned apple. Snow White fell into a deathlike sleep. The dwarfs placed her in a glass coffin.
A prince found her and was so moved by her beauty that he kissed her. Snow White awakened, and they married. The evil Queen was defeated.
