Goldilocks wandered into a house in the forest where three bears lived. She tried their porridge: Papa Bear's was too hot, Mama Bear's was too cold, but Baby Bear's was just right, so she ate it all.
She tried their chairs: Papa Bear's was too hard, Mama Bear's was too soft, but Baby Bear's was just right. She sat so hard that she broke it.
Upstairs, she tried their beds: Papa Bear's was too hard, Mama Bear's was too soft, but Baby Bear's was just right, and she fell asleep.
The bears came home and found someone had been eating their porridge, sitting in their chairs, and sleeping in their beds.
"Someone's been sleeping in my bed and she's still there!" cried Baby Bear.
Goldilocks woke up, saw the three bears, jumped out the window, and ran away. She never returned.
