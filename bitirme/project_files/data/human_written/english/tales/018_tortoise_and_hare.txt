A Hare was making fun of the Tortoise one day for being so slow.
"Do you ever get anywhere?" he asked with a mocking laugh.
"Yes," replied the Tortoise, "and I get there sooner than you think. I'll run you a race and prove it."
The Hare was amused and agreed. The Fox marked the distance and started the runners.
The Hare quickly ran far ahead and, to mock the Tortoise, lay down to take a nap. The Tortoise kept moving slowly but steadily, and eventually passed the sleeping Hare.
When the Hare finally woke up, the Tortoise was near the goal. The Hare ran his fastest, but could not catch up in time.
