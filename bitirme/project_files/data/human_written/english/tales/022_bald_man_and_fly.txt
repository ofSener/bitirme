A Bald Man was stung by a Fly on his head. In his eagerness to kill the Fly, he gave himself a hard slap with his hand. But the Fly had already flown away, and he had only hurt himself.
The Fly, settled safely on the wall, said: "You tried to kill me for a mere little sting; what will you do to yourself since you have hit yourself much harder than I did?"
The Bald Man replied: "I can easily forgive myself, for I had no intention to hurt myself. But you, you blood-sucking pest, who take delight in sucking human blood, I would have killed you even if I had to hurt myself more than I have."
