On a cold New Year's Eve, a poor little girl wandered the streets trying to sell matches. She was afraid to go home because her father would beat her for not selling any.
She huddled in a corner and lit a match to warm herself. In the flame, she saw a warm stove. When the match went out, the vision disappeared.
She lit another match and saw a feast with roast goose. A third match showed a beautiful Christmas tree. In the fourth match, she saw her beloved grandmother who had died.
"Take me with you, Grandmother!" cried the girl. She lit all her remaining matches, and her grandmother took her in her arms and carried her to heaven where there was no cold or hunger.
The next morning, people found the little girl frozen in the corner, with burned matches around her, a smile on her face.
