The Cop and the Anthem
by O. Henry

On his bench in Madison Square, Soapy moved restlessly. When wild geese honk high overhead, when women without seal coats grow kind to their husbands, and when Soapy becomes restless, you know that winter is near.

Soapy knew that the time had come for him to prepare for the annual migration to Blackwell's Island. For years, this ritual had marked the approach of winter. When the cold weather arrived, Soapy would find a way to get himself arrested so he could spend the harsh months in the warm comfort of the city jail.

Three months in jail seemed quite desirable to Soapy. Three months of food every day and a bed every night, three months away from the north winds and policemen's clubs. Therefore, it was time to become a criminal.

Soapy left his bench and strolled out of the square toward the lights of a restaurant on Broadway. This would be easy. He would go in, order a feast, eat it, and then announce that he had no money. The waiter would call a cop, and Soapy would be on his way to Blackwell's Island.

He entered the restaurant and sat down at a table. "I'll have some ham and eggs," he told the waiter, "and a cup of coffee." The waiter looked at Soapy's ragged clothes and worn shoes, then walked away. A head waiter approached.

"Out!" said the head waiter firmly. Two waiters grabbed Soapy by the arms and marched him to the sidewalk. Soapy had failed in his first attempt.

On the opposite side of the street was a smaller restaurant with less elegant decorations. Soapy entered and devoured beefsteak, flapjacks, doughnuts, and pie. Then he told the waiter he had no money.

"Call a cop," Soapy said. "I can't pay."

The waiter grinned and called out, "Hey, Kon! Come here!"

A burly man appeared. Without a word, he grabbed Soapy and threw him onto the sidewalk. The waiter explained that they didn't call the police—they handled things themselves.

Soapy picked himself up and tried again. He saw a well-dressed man window shopping and quickly grabbed an umbrella from his hand.

"Hey! That's my umbrella!" shouted the man.

"Then call a policeman," said Soapy hopefully. "I took it. I'm a thief."

The man examined the umbrella. "Well," he said awkwardly, "I suppose it might not be mine after all. I picked it up at a restaurant this morning. Sorry." He walked away, leaving Soapy with the umbrella.

Frustrated, Soapy tried a different approach. He picked up a large stone and hurled it through a shop window. The glass crashed loudly to the ground. Soapy stood calmly waiting for the policeman who would surely come running.

A policeman did come, but he ran right past Soapy and grabbed another man who was running away. "It must have been that guy," the officer thought.

Growing desperate, Soapy tried disturbing the peace. He shouted and danced in the street like a drunken man. But the policeman on the beat merely thought he was a celebrating college student and turned away with a smile.

Finally, Soapy found himself standing before an old church. Soft music was flowing from within—a beautiful anthem that spoke of love, hope, and redemption. As he listened, something stirred in Soapy's soul. The anthem reminded him of better days, of his mother, of dreams he had once cherished.

In that moment, Soapy resolved to change his life. He would find work, make something of himself, become respectable. Tomorrow he would go into the business district and look for a job. The anthem had awakened something noble within him.

"What are you doing here?" came a gruff voice.

Soapy turned to see a policeman standing behind him.

"Nothing," said Soapy.

"Come along," said the policeman. "You're under arrest for loitering."

The next morning, a judge sentenced Soapy to three months in prison on Blackwell's Island.

Thus, just when Soapy had found the inspiration to reform his life and seek honest work, fate played its final ironic hand. He got exactly what he had been trying to achieve all along—but only after he no longer wanted it.
