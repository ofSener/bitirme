I am a student from France and live in a small apartment outside of
London. Every month I have to pay a lot of bills. The rent is an important
bill and costs me more than anything else. Every month I pay the rent, the
water bill, my phone, and the electricity bill. I usually have the bills
automatically deducted from my account. If my account is empty, I will
wire transfer the money. Contracts must be taken seriously and are very
important in England! If you breach a contract in this country you will
certainly get into trouble. If your income is fluctuating it is probably best
to avoid contracts.
