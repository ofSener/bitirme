Three days ago, I received my driver's license. With a driving license, I
can drive almost any car in the United Kingdom, and in most other
European countries as well. I received my license shortly after my 18th
birthday. It's important that I can use my license everywhere because I
need to drive to Spain soon.
Unlike in other countries, such as the US, the making of a driver's license in
Europe can be very expensive. But there are some differences in Europe.
For instance, in Germany, a driver's license is valid for as long as you live.
Today I will be on the highway alone for the first time, driving my fatherâ€™s
car, a Porsche. I'm going to drive slowly and leave the beer bottles at
home.
