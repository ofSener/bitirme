I sit with several students in a café in Paris.
We have an international meeting. Americans, French, and Germans sit at
a table and discuss.
The American asks, "What does culture mean in this country?"
I say, "That term can mean a lot. Literature, theatre, art, or even the way we
speak, including the way you conduct yourself."
"Does it also include behavior? " asks the American.
"Behavior in general terms, probably is a part of it," says the German.
"So that means when I behave I have culture," ask the American smiling.
"More or less,“ I reply. "But education and manners would also describe
culture"
"Can one say in France as well that I have culture, and you do not?" asks
the American.
"No, that would be arrogant," I assert.
