An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge
by Ambrose Bierce

A man stood upon a railroad bridge in northern Alabama, looking down into the swift water twenty feet below. His hands were bound behind his back with a cord. A rope encircled his neck, attached to a stout cross-timber above his head. Some loose boards laid upon the railway ties supplied a footing for him and his executioners—two private soldiers of the Federal army, directed by a sergeant.

The man who was about to be hanged was perhaps thirty-five years of age. He was a civilian, and his features were good—a kindly expression which one would hardly have expected in one whose neck was in the hemp. Evidently this was no vulgar assassin. The preparations being complete, the two private soldiers stepped aside and each drew away the plank upon which he had been standing. The sergeant turned to the captain, saluted, and placed himself immediately behind that officer.

At a signal from the captain, the sergeant stepped aside. Peyton Farquhar, for that was the condemned man's name, fell straight downward through the bridge.

As Peyton Farquhar fell from the bridge, the world seemed to slow around him. He was acutely conscious of everything—the beating of his heart, the texture of the rope around his neck, the sound of his watch ticking in his pocket. Then the rope tightened around his throat, and everything went black.

When consciousness returned, he found himself in the water below the bridge. The fall had somehow broken the rope! His bound hands were free, and he began swimming desperately toward the surface. The water around him was illuminated by the flash of rifles as the soldiers on the bridge fired at him. He dove deep, swimming underwater as bullets whistled overhead.

With superhuman effort, Peyton reached the shore and began running through the forest. Behind him, he could hear the shouts of his pursuers and the baying of bloodhounds. But something strange was happening—his senses seemed impossibly acute. He could see individual leaves on trees miles away, hear the flutter of insect wings, and feel the texture of each dewdrop beneath his bare feet.

All day he traveled through the wild forest, following an unknown road that led away from his captors. The thought of his wife and children gave him strength. He had not eaten since morning, yet he felt no hunger. The pain in his neck from the rope had strangely disappeared.

As night fell, Peyton found himself approaching a familiar gate. It was his own plantation! He could see the house at the end of the avenue of trees, its windows glowing warmly in the darkness. His wife appeared on the veranda, looking as beautiful and fresh as she had when he left. She stepped down from the veranda to meet him.

As he moved to embrace her, Peyton felt a stunning blow upon the back of his neck. A blinding white light blazed all about him with a sound like the shock of a cannon. Then all was darkness and silence.

Peyton Farquhar was dead. His body, with a broken neck, swung gently from side to side beneath the timbers of the Owl Creek bridge.

The elaborate escape, the sensory experiences, the long journey home—all of it had occurred in the few seconds between his fall from the bridge and the moment the noose tightened around his neck. In those final moments of life, his desperate mind had created an entire fantasy of escape and reunion, a beautiful illusion that lasted no longer than it takes for a hanged man to die.

The Federal soldiers looked down at the still form, then turned away to continue their patrol. The war would go on, but Peyton Farquhar's small act of rebellion had ended with his life at Owl Creek Bridge, where he had attempted to burn the very structure from which he now hung.
