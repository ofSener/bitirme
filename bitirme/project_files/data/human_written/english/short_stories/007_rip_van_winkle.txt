Rip Van Winkle
by Washington Irving

In a pleasant village at the foot of New York's Kaatskill Mountains, there lived a simple, good-natured man named Rip Van Winkle. All the children in the village loved him, for he would play with them, teach them to fly kites and spin tops, and tell them long stories.

Rip was very kind to children and animals, but he had one terrible problem—he was lazy. His wife, Dame Van Winkle, was always scolding him for his idleness. She would complain that the farm was falling to pieces, the cow was going astray, and the fence was broken. Instead of working, Rip would sit in front of the inn with other idle men, telling stories about the old days.

To escape his wife's scolding, Rip would take his gun and his dog Wolf and wander into the mountains. One autumn day, while hunting squirrels, he heard someone calling his name. He saw a strange little man dressed in old-fashioned Dutch clothes, carrying a keg on his back. Without speaking, the man motioned for Rip to help him carry the keg.

They climbed to a hollow in the mountains where Rip saw the most peculiar sight—a group of little men, all dressed in the same old-fashioned way, playing ninepins. Their faces were serious, and they played in complete silence except for the sound of the balls rolling and pins falling like thunder through the mountains.

The little man Rip had helped made signs for him to serve drinks from the keg. Though frightened, Rip obeyed. After a while, his fear subsided, and when no one was looking, he tasted the liquor. It was excellent, so he continued to drink until he fell into a deep sleep.

When Rip awoke, he found himself on the green knoll where he had first met the strange man. The sun was shining brightly, and he assumed he had slept through the night. "Surely Dame Van Winkle will give me a terrible scolding," he thought.

As he looked for his gun, he found an old rusty firelock lying beside him instead of his clean, well-oiled rifle. His dog Wolf was nowhere to be found. Rip whistled and called, but no dog came running.

When Rip descended to the village, everything seemed different. The houses looked older, and there were people everywhere he didn't recognize. They stared at him strangely and pointed at his long gray beard. Rip was confused—when had his beard grown so long?

At his own house, he found the windows broken and the door hanging from its hinges. Inside, everything was empty and decaying. At the inn, instead of the old tree where he used to sit, there was a tall flagpole with a strange flag he had never seen before.

"Where are all my old friends?" Rip asked. An old man told him that Nicholas Vedder had been dead for eighteen years, and Brom Dutcher had died in the war. "What war?" asked Rip, bewildered. The old man stared at him as if he were mad.

"Why, the Revolutionary War, of course! Where have you been these twenty years?"

Twenty years! Rip could hardly believe it. Just then, a young woman with a child approached. She looked exactly like his wife had looked twenty years ago. "What is your name, good woman?" he asked.

"Judith Gardenier."

"And your father's name?"

"Ah, poor man, his name was Rip Van Winkle. He went away from home twenty years ago with his gun and never returned. We never knew what became of him."

Rip realized this was his own daughter, now grown up with a child of her own. "I am your father!" he cried. "Young Rip Van Winkle once—old Rip Van Winkle now!"

His daughter took him to live with her, and he soon became a favorite in the village once again. He would sit at the inn and tell his story to every stranger who arrived. Some believed him, others thought he was mad, but the old Dutch inhabitants knew better—they had always heard strange stories about the Kaatskill Mountains and the ghosts of Henry Hudson's crew who were said to play ninepins there during thunderstorms.

Rip never worked again—he had grown too old and stiff for labor—but nobody minded. After all, he had earned a twenty-year rest. As for Dame Van Winkle, she had died years ago, so Rip could finally live in peace. He spent his remaining years sitting by the inn, with his long white beard flowing to his knees, telling his wonderful story to anyone who would listen.
