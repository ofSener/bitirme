The Star Fisherman

Every night, an old fisherman cast his nets into the sky instead of the sea. He caught falling stars, which he'd release at dawn, except for the broken ones. These he'd mend with silver thread and prayers before setting free. The village mocked him until the night sky began dimming. Stars were disappearing, not falling. The fisherman knew whyâ€”broken stars weren't healing, creating black holes of sadness. He taught the villagers his craft: catching, mending, releasing. Together, they healed the sky. Children learned that stars, like people, sometimes need catching when they fall, mending when they break, and releasing when they're ready. The night sky brightened, and falling stars became wishes again.
