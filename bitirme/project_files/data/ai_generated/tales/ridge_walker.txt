The Ridge Walker

A woman walked the ridges between worldsâ€”the thin places where reality overlapped. On mountain peaks at dawn, in doorways at twilight, at shorelines during storms. She'd guide lost souls who'd slipped between worlds back to their proper places. But she noticed some souls chose to stay lost, finding peace in the between-spaces. She stopped forcing them back, instead teaching them to navigate the ridges safely. These ridge-walkers became messengers between worlds, carrying dreams to the waking, prayers to the divine, love to the departed. The woman learned that some people belong in margins, and boundaries aren't walls but meeting places. She proved that getting lost might be finding where you truly belong.
