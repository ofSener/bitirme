The Echo Keeper

In mountain caves lived a keeper of echoes. Not sound reflections, but emotional echoesâ€”the lingering feelings places absorb. She'd bottle echoes of first kisses from park benches, collect graduation joy from auditoriums, gather grief from hospital halls. People came seeking specific echoes: widowers wanting their wives' laughter from kitchen walls, children seeking grandparents' stories from porch swings. But echoes fade if not renewed. The keeper taught visitors to leave new echoes, refreshing emotional imprints. They learned that places hold memories only if we feed them with present moments. The caves became an archive of human feeling, teaching that we leave invisible parts of ourselves everywhere, creating an emotional map of our lives.
