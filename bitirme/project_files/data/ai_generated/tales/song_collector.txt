The Song Collector

A boy collected songs like others collected stamps. Not recordings, but the actual songs—pulled from the air as birds sang them, captured from mothers' lullabies, stolen from wind through leaves. He kept them in glass jars, labeled and dated. His room sparkled with imprisoned melodies. One silent winter, when no birds sang and snow muffled all sound, the village grew depressed. The boy realized his collection had stolen their joy. He opened every jar. Songs burst forth—spring returned to winter, birds sang in snow, children laughed again. The boy learned that beauty isn't meant to be possessed but shared. Now he teaches others to listen, not capture, and the village overflows with music no jar could contain.
