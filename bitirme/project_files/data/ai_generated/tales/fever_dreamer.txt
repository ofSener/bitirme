The Fever Dreamer

When ill with fever, a child could dream futures into existence. Her fever visions became tomorrow's reality—dream of rain, morning brought storms; imagine healing, sickness fled. Parents kept her healthy, fearing her power. But when plague came, they needed her fever dreams. They made her sick deliberately, guiding her delirium toward salvation. She dreamed of herbs glowing where medicine grew, of clean water running uphill, of healing songs birds would teach. Everything manifested. But the child learned that fever dreams exact prices—each forced future stole a natural one. She taught the village to work with fate, not override it. They learned that power to change tomorrow means responsibility for all the tomorrows that won't exist.
