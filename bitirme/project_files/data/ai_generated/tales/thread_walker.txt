The Thread Walker

A boy could see and walk on invisible threads connecting all living things. Step on the thread between mother and child, feel their bond. Balance on threads between strangers, understand their hidden connections. He'd repair broken threads with silver needles, strengthening failing relationships. But he discovered that cutting threads could be mercyâ€”toxic connections, painful attachments, chains disguised as love. He learned discernment, when to mend and when to cut. The boy taught others to sense their threads, to nurture healthy connections and release harmful ones. People realized they were all walking a web of relationships, and every action tugged threads in ways they couldn't see but could learn to feel.
