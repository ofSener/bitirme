The Breath Merchant

A merchant sold bottles of last breaths—famous last words made tangible. Poets' final exhalations inspired creativity, warriors' death rattles gave courage, mothers' last sighs offered comfort. Collections grew valuable, museums displayed historical breath. But the merchant noticed that focusing on last breaths made people forget first ones—babies' initial cries, lovers' first gasps, surprised laughter. She began collecting living breath, everyday exhalations of working, loving, surviving. These proved more valuable than famous last breaths. People learned that ordinary breathing is the real miracle, not dramatic finals. The merchant proved that we trade millions of breaths without notice, and perhaps the most important breath is the one we're taking right now.
