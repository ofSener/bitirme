The Footprint Reader

An old woman read stories in footprints—not just direction and gait, but entire life narratives. A child's skip revealed dreams, a mother's shuffle showed exhaustion, a thief's tiptoe whispered guilt. She'd sit by paths, reading humanity's stories written in dust and mud. Officials hired her to solve crimes, but she preferred reading love stories in paired footprints, adventures in running shoes, wisdom in slow elderly steps. When concrete covered all paths, footprints vanished. She taught people to leave intentional marks—dance steps in rain, messages in sand, patterns in snow. The world became a canvas for footprint stories. She proved that we all leave marks, and choosing how we step is choosing how we're remembered.
