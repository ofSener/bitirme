The Ash Prophet

After every fire, a prophet read futures in the ashes. House fires revealed family destinies, forest fires showed civilization's path, candle ash whispered personal prophecies. People brought her their ashes, desperate for tomorrow's news. But she noticed that knowing futures made people passive, waiting for prophecies instead of creating them. She began mixing ashes with clay, teaching people to sculpt their own futures from remnants of the past. They learned that ashes weren't just endings but materials for new beginnings. The prophet proved that destruction provides ingredients for creation, and reading the future is less important than writing it. She showed that prophecy isn't about prediction but about understanding that every ending contains a beginning.
