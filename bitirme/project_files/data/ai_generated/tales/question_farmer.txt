The Question Farmer

A farmer planted questions instead of seeds. "Why?" grew tall like corn. "What if?" spread like strawberries. "How?" rooted deep like potatoes. People came to harvest answers, but found only more questions sprouting. Frustrated, they demanded solutions. The farmer smiled, "Questions are the only crop that feeds the mind forever. Answers satisfy temporarily, but questions cultivate wisdom." A scholar stayed to study, discovering that tending questions carefully—watering with curiosity, fertilizing with wonder—yielded insights better than any answer. The farm became a school where children learned to grow their own questions, understanding that the best education isn't receiving answers but learning which questions to plant and how to tend them patiently.
