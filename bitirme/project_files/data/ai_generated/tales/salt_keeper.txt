The Salt Keeper

By the sea lived a woman who harvested tears from the ocean—not water, but the salt of every tear that ever joined the sea. Each grain held someone's sorrow: shipwrecked sailors, grieving widows, heartbroken children. She'd sell this salt to those who couldn't cry, helping them release stuck grief. But the salt began sweetening as she collected it, tears of sorrow mixing with tears of joy. She realized the ocean held all human emotions, not just sadness. She taught people to taste life like salt—sometimes bitter, sometimes sweet, always essential. The keeper proved that tears, like the ocean, connect all humanity in a vast emotional sea, where individual drops become universal tides.
