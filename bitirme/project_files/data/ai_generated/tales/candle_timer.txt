The Candle Timer

A candlemaker created candles that burned backward through time. Light one, and you'd relive that duration in reverse—hour candles for recent mistakes, day candles for missed opportunities, year candles for lost loves. People bought them desperately, wanting to undo, redo, unsay. But living backward proved disorienting—knowing endings while experiencing beginnings, feeling grief before joy. Most couldn't handle the reversal. The candlemaker started making present candles—burning them kept you absolutely present, unable to drift to past or future. These sold better. People learned that living backward doesn't change what happened, only tortures with knowledge. The timer taught that time moves one direction for good reason, and presence is the only temporal gift worth seeking.
