At the night market, a banyan held the roof up with its own imagination. Stalls gathered like planets: noodles, incense, knockoff sneakers, a woman who read palms and recipes. I sold postcards I’d drawn—lanterns, cats, the banyan itself. An old man traced a root aerial as a vein. “This tree adopts lost air,” he said. A blackout melted neon; the banyan kept twilight anyway. Vendors lit candles; the noodle broth glowed. A sudden rain braided through leaves but couldn’t reach us. I traded two postcards for a bowl and a story about the banyan surviving a war under tarps and stubborn singing. When the power returned, no one cheered. We were already lit, stitched to branches by steam and laughter.
