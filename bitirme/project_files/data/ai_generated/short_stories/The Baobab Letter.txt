Grandmother dictated a letter to the baobab back home. “Dear fat friend,” she began, grinning at my scandal. She described city snow, a stubborn radiator, the way pigeons mispronounce morning. “Tell the village I remember,” she said. We sealed the envelope and walked it to the park’s lone baobab—imported, fenced, dignified. She slipped the letter through the rails. “Trees are better postmen,” she explained. Weeks later, a package arrived: dried hibiscus, photos, news of a new well. Tucked inside, a leaf pressed flat as a passport stamp. Grandmother held it to her cheek. “Delivery confirmed,” she said. That evening, we visited the park. The baobab stood moon-round and listening. “Reply sent,” I whispered, hands on bark, learning the address by heart.
