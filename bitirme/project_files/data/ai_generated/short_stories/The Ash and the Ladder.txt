Firefighters visited our block to inspect hydrants and hearts. Captain Singh eyed the dead ash by the corner store, marked with caution paint and nostalgia. “Emerald borer,” he said, respectful as at a funeral. We asked for one more summer. He shrugged, left a ladder “for community use.” Soon, the dead ash became a stage: kids practicing speeches, a guitarist rehearsing bravery, elders telling jokes with long tails. The ladder leaned like punctuation, daring commas into exclamation points. In September, the city crew came with saws and apologies. We gathered, unsentimental but grateful. After, Captain Singh returned with saplings—elm, hackberry, a stubborn honeylocust. We planted them around the stump like a chorus. The ladder stayed, waiting for the next voice.
