The town square kept a cedar that didn’t believe in ornaments. Every December, committees argued tinsel; the tree answered with fragrance, steady and green. This year, the power grid sulked through a cold snap. Shops closed early; breath turned to lace. Someone suggested gathering anyway—thermoses, blankets, music without plugs. We stood beneath the cedar, trading stories like mittens. A baker handed out un-iced cookies shaped like moons. The choir hummed; our boots kept rhythm. Snow began in careful handwriting. Then a child produced a small lantern, set it at the cedar’s roots. One after another, we added candles in jars until the tree had a quiet constellation. No ornaments, just light. The power returned later. We lingered, warmed already.
