Our seaside pine collected lost kites like an eccentric auntâ€”pirate flags, soccer teams, rainbows with tangled tails. Kids called it Treasure Tree. Each windy Saturday, we attempted rescues with poles and borrowed ladders. The pine kept most trophies, offering instead pitch on our sleeves and lessons on humility. One day, a storm punched the coast. Afterward, the village roofline looked like a gap-toothed grin. The pine stood sticky but unbroken, its crown a gallery of stubborn color. We strung a line from trunk to driftwood and hung clothespins for found things: gloves, notes, a single sandal. By midsummer, the line blurred into bunting. The pine kept its kites, and we kept each other, stitched by string and weather.
