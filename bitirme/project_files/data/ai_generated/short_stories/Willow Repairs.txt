The bridge washed out in spring, so the village detoured past the willow, a generous fountain of shade. The carpenter set up sawhorses there; I brought nails and cookies. People arrived with problems disguised as errands: a chair with three loyal legs, a clock that refused afternoons, a heart. The willow trailed its green hair in the creek, eavesdropping. We mended what could be mended and labeled what couldn’t: “needs time,” “needs glue,” “needs laughter plus glue.” When the new bridge opened, cars resumed pretending they were alone. Still, some of us kept stopping at the willow on purpose, bringing unhurried news. The carpenter carved a small sign and hung it from a low branch: “Repairs Continue.”
