The Coffee Shop Equation

Marcus scribbled equations on napkins every morning at the corner café. Numbers danced across cheap paper, seeking patterns in chaos. The barista, Elena, watched curiously while crafting his usual cappuccino. One day, she noticed something peculiar—his equations predicted exact customer counts, weather changes, even her mood. "How do you know these things?" she whispered. Marcus smiled sadly, "I don't know the future; I calculate probabilities from infinite parallel presents." He showed her an equation predicting two futures: one where she asks him to dinner, another where she doesn't. Elena grabbed his pen, crossed out the second option, and wrote her phone number beside the first. Sometimes, she realized, the best calculations are the ones we choose to make true.
