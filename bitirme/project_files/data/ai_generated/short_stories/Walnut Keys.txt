My piano teacher kept a jar of walnut shells on the lid. “Practice memory,” she said, clicking two halves together like castanets. When my father forgot the back door open and fear moved in, lessons stopped. Months later, I returned to find the teacher thinner, the walnut tree out back thunderstruck but standing. She placed a shell in my palm. “Crack it.” Inside, meat shaped like a brain, ordinary and miraculous. We learned a new piece, slow and forgiving. Each measure felt like stepping stones across a river that didn’t rush us. After recital, I pocketed three shells. At home, father dozed in afternoon light. I tapped the shells together softly. He smiled, waking. “That song,” he said, and hummed the rest.
