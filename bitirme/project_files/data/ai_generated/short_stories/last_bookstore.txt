The Last Bookstore

In 2087, Amelia ran Earth's last physical bookstore. Digital minds had long replaced paper, but she kept her shop open for the curious few. Today, a child enteredâ€”the first in months. "What are these?" the boy asked, touching a dusty spine. "Stories," Amelia replied, "but you hold them, smell them, feel their weight." She opened an illustrated fairy tale. The boy's eyes widened as he turned actual pages, no screens, no holograms. His fingers traced the gold lettering, felt the paper's texture. "It's like the story lives here," he whispered. Amelia nodded, remembering when millions understood this magic. As the boy left with three books, she noticed others gathering outside, drawn by his wonder. Perhaps, she thought, some things aren't meant to be upgraded.
