The city planted twelve plane trees along Harbor Street. August delivered a bakery—cinnamon, laughter, spilled coffee. September raised scaffolding, rent debates, and a coral-bright mural. Winter arrived thin. Someone tied mittens to a branch with a note, “Take one.” In March, toddlers slapped puddles; a trumpeter rehearsed; a poet scribbled on receipts. The plane trees shook off dust and opened a canopy shaped like a promise. When a heat wave spread like a sheet, their shade became a currency no one hoarded. People slowed, shared benches, passed water bottles between strangers. A barista proposed beneath leaf-flecked light; yes sounded like wind. Years later, the mural faded, shops changed, rumors moved on. The trees stayed, counting seasons, lending patience.
