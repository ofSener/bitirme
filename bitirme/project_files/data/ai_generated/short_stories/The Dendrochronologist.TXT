Dr. Hale read trees the way others read diaries. In the lab, cross-sections glowed like vinyl records—rings tight with drought, wide with abundance, scarred with fire. A farmer arrived carrying a fallen walnut from his boundary fence. “Tell me why it failed,” he asked. Hale traced a dark spiral: beetles. A sudden thin band: the year his wife was ill. The farmer blinked. “We stopped irrigating,” he said. Another ring boomed with generosity; the farmer smiled. “Best harvest of my life.” Hale sanded, counted, annotated. Before the farmer left, she pressed a printout into his calloused hand: a timeline, not an autopsy. “It didn’t fail,” she said. “It finished.” He drove home slower, passing orchards that looked, for once, like libraries.
