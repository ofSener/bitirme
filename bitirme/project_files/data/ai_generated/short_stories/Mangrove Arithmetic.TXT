My father explained resilience using mangroves. “They grow where salt argues,” he said, pushing our boat through shoelace roots. The tide kept a ledger: arrival, departure, loss, return. When the storm took our painted shack, we slept on cousins’ floors and counted missing things—one radio, two windows, three jokes swallowed by rain. Weeks later, we planted five mangrove seedlings along the new shoreline. Crabs approved, clicking like abacuses. Father taught me to rinse the seedlings’ leaves so salt wouldn’t win. By the next equinox, we measured shade on our wrists, cool inches increasing. The radio stayed gone, but pelicans resumed their flights, and our jokes came back unbroken. Resilience, I learned, is math you do with roots.
