The consulate line wrapped the block, paper birds fluttering from clipboards. Across the street, a plane tree ran immigration for shade. We shared it freely: cooks, students, a grandmother reciting proverbs to steady a baby. I coached a stranger through form 47-B, he corrected my accent kindly. The plane tree dropped a speckled leaf onto my application like an official stamp. Inside, fluorescent lights and numbered windows sorted us into stories. Outside, the tree kept our place without judgment. When my number finally blinked, I stepped forward less alone. Weeks later, I returned with approval, slid a ribbon around a low branch, not a lock. The tree needed no keys, only our passing promises, rustling into a shared passport.
