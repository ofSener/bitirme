We marked time by the acacia outside our tent. Its shade migrated like a faithful clock, spilling noon over the tea kettle. Sand argued with everything—skin, teeth, tents—but the tree held its ground with roots like handwriting. When the aid truck came monthly, we bartered beadwork for flour and stories. The driver called our acacia “mile four.” During drought, goats chewed even rumors of leaves; still, birds returned at dawn, bold and opinionated. One night, wind unzipped the horizon. We woke to a hush so deep even sand listened. Lightning stitched a brief river. By morning, the acacia had caught a small miracle: fresh pods, sticky and green. We brewed tea sweeter than ration sugar, and the day softened.
