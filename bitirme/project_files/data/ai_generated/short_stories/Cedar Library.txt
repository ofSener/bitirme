Our town rebuilt the library with cedar beams that smelled like pencils dreaming. The children’s corner sprouted a story tree—carved trunk, wide platform, cushions like moss. I shelved returns, learning the taxonomy of wishes: travel, repair, dragons, first chances. One evening, the power flickered; the building breathed wood and patience. We handed out headlamps and kept reading. A child asked why the tree didn’t grow real leaves. “It grows readers,” I said, hearing my own corniness and not minding. Volunteers organized a seed library, envelopes labeled in shaky fonts. People borrowed marigolds, tomatoes, a risky moonflower. By autumn, patrons arrived with jars and photos, paying fines in zinnias. The cedar creaked approvingly. We stamped due dates with sap-scented ink and stayed late.
