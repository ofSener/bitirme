The Midnight Train

Sarah clutched her worn ticket as the midnight train pulled into the deserted station. Steam hissed, obscuring the platform in ghostly wisps. She'd been waiting here every night for three months, following the cryptic note her grandmother left: "Board the midnight train when autumn leaves turn gold." Tonight, golden leaves swirled around her feet. The conductor, an elderly man with knowing eyes, simply nodded. Inside, the train was empty except for one passengerâ€”a young woman who looked exactly like Sarah's grandmother from old photographs. "I've been waiting," the woman smiled, patting the seat beside her. As the train departed, Sarah realized some journeys transcend time itself. Outside, the familiar station faded into a landscape she'd never seen before.
