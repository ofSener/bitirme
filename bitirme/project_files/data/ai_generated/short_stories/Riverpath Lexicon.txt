Marla cataloged trees the way other people collect stamps. She walked the riverpath whispering names: alder, willow, cottonwood. When her mother lost words, Marla brought her here. “What’s that one?” she asked gently. Her mother squinted, fingertips reading bark like braille. “Memory,” she decided, and they laughed. A heron lifted, lazy as a page turning. Wind riffled leaves into applause. They sat until sunlight pooled gold at their shoes. Later, the doctor said decline is a slow tide. Marla nodded, but returned anyway with thermos tea and sticky notes. On each trunk she wrote: “home,” “today,” “you.” The river kept the rhythm; the trees kept the glossary. Some afternoons her mother remembered alder. Other days, they just remembered laughing.
